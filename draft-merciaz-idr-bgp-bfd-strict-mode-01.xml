        <t>
            This document specifies extensions to RFC4271 BGP-4 that enable a BGP speaker to signal additional Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) extensions using an optional parameter BFD capability. This BFD capability enables a BGP speaker to prevent a BGP session from being established until a BFD session is established. It is referred to as BGP BFD “strict-mode”. BGP BFD strict-mode will be supported when both the local speaker and its remote peer are BFD strict-mode capable, Otherwise, a BGP speaker and its peer should not require a BFD session for BGP session establishment.

      <section title="Introduction">
          <t>
              Bidirectional Forwarding Detection BFD <xref target="RFC5882"/> enables routers to monitor data plane connectivity and to detect faults in the bidirectional forwarding path between them. This capability is leveraged by routing protocols such as BGP <xref target="RFC4271"/> to rapidly react to topology changes in the face of path failures.
          </t>
          <t>
The BFD interaction with BGP is specified in Section 10.2 of <xref target="RFC5882"/>. When BFD is enabled for a BGP neighbor, faults in the bidirectional forwarding detected by BFD result in session termination. It is possible in some failure scenarios for the network to be in a state such that a BGP session may be established but a BFD session cannot be established. In some other scenarios, it may be possible to establish a BGP session, but a degraded or poor-quality link may result in the corresponding BFD session going up and down frequently.
</t>
<t>
To avoid situations which result in routing churn and to minimize the impact of network interruptions, it will be beneficial to disallow BGP to establish a neighbor session until BFD session is successfully established and has stabilized. We refer to this mode of operation as BGP BFD “strict-mode”. However, always using
strict-mode” would preclude BGP operation in an environment where not all routers support BFD strict-mode or have BFD enabled.
This document defines BGP “strict-mode” operation as preventing BGP session establishment until both the local and remove speakers have a stable BFD session.
The document also specifies the BGP protocol extensions for BGP capability <xref target="RFC5492"/> for announcing BFD
parameters including a BGP speaker’s support for “strict-mode”, i.e., requiring a BFD session for
BGP session establishment.

           The BGP Capability <xref target="RFC5492"/> for BFD parameters will allow a BGP speaker’s BFD capabilities
           including its support for BFD strict-mode. This capability is defined as follows:

              The most significant bit is defined as state of Strict-Mode ("Strict-Mode", or "S") bit, which can be used by a BGP speaker to signal its support for BFD Strict-mode. When set (value 1), this bit indicates that the BGP speaker has the BFD “Strict-mode” enabled. If both local BGP speaker and its peer are enabled with BFD strict-mode, then BGP session establishment will be disallowed until a BFD session is established. A BGP speaker with BFD strict-mode enabled MUST advertise the BFD capability with “S” bit value 1.
      </t>
      <t>
          The remaining bits are reserved and SHOULD be set to zero by the
          sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver.

  </t>

  </section>

  <section anchor="operation" title="Operation">
      <t>
          A BGP speaker that supports capabilities advertisement sends an OPEN message to its BGP peer,
          the message MAY include an Optional Parameter, called Capabilities.
          The parameter lists the capabilities supported by the speaker. By following BGP capabilities
          advertisement procedures defined in <xref target="RFC5492"/>, BFD capability advertisement for
          strict-mode is advertised to BGP peers.
      </t>
      <t> 
          If both BGP speakers advertise the BFD capability with the strict-mode bit set, then the BGP 
          state machine will be held in OpenConfirm state <xref target="RFC4271"/> until a BFD session
          is established or the BGP session is terminated for some other reason (e.g., the BGP Hold time
          expires.
      </t> 
  <t>
      A BGP speaker which supports capabilities advertisement and has BFD strict-mode enabled MUST include the BGP BFD capability with the “S” Bit set in the BGP capabilities it advertises.
      </t>
      <t>
          A BGP speaker which supports BFD capability advertisement, examines the list
          of capabilities present in the Capabilities BFD Parameter that the speaker
          receives from its peer. If both the local and remote BGP speakers BFD strict-mode enabled,
          then the BGP session will be held in OpenConfirm state until a BFD session is established 
          between the two BGP speaker or the BGP session terminates for some other reason,
          e.g., the BGP hold timer expires. If either peer
          has not advertised the BFD Capability with strict-mode enabled, then a BFD session WILL NOT
          be required for the BGP session to reach Established state. This does not preclude usage of
          BFD after BGP session establishment <xref target="RFC5882"/>.
  </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Backward Compatibility">
     <t>
      The BFD capability will no introduce any backward compatibility will not result in any backward compatibility issues as
      long as the procedures in <xref target="RFC5492"/> and <xref target="operation"/> are followed.
      A BGP speaker which does not support or recognize the BFD capability should ignore the BFD capability.
      If a BGP speaker advertising the capability receives the Unsupported Capability NOTIFICATION message, it MUST NOT
      result in BGP session termination. Rather, the BGP speaker advertising the BFD capability SHOULD simply 
      resend its capabilities with the BFD capability omitted.
      </t>
  </section>
  <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
          This specification doesn't change the basic security model inherent in <xref target="RFC4271"/>. To the extent <xref target="RFC4271"/> might be said to help defend against denials of service by making the control plane more resilient, this extension may modestly increase that resilience; however, there are enough confounding and deployment-specific factors that no general claims can be made.
  </t>
      </section>
      <section title="IANA Considerations">
          <t>
              This document defines a new BGP capability – BFD Capability. The Capability Code for BFD Capability is TBD.
      </t>
      <t>
          IANA is requested to establish a “BGP BFD Capability Flags” registry within the "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Parameters" grouping. The Registration Procedure should be Standards Action, the initial values as follows:
